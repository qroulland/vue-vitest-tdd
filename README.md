# Vue-vitest-tdd

Short project to practice the TDD method with the FizzBuzz kata.

## Project objectives

To fully understand the TDD steps, let's take a concrete example with the simple FizzBuzz kata (famous for its frequent use in recruitment tests).

### Features

The FizzBuzz kata asks us to write a program that displays:
- Fizz if the number is a multiple of 3
- Buzz if the number is a multiple of 5
- FizzBuzz if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5
- The number itself in all other cases
